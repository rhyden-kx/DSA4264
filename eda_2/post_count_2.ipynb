      "13662     gt you literally said its not fun when you have to pay sgd 17k for a room you share toilet and common spaces with 23 other people when hdb rental in singapore is like sgd2k for a 2 bedroom apartment isnt that complaining\\n\\nthat is not my situation by the way im just giving ballpark figures based on the typical person in bay area\\n\\ngt yes you poor thing complaining on your 100k salary while this thread is full of people who earn less than half that maybe use some of that empathy you have for the people reading this thread\\n\\ni didnt even show off any salary data chill you assume that i am boasting i can tell you im not why would i boast in the first place what do i gain from stupid internet points\\n\\ngt i dont even know why you even started talking about col in the bay area when this thread is about sg talk about your rent for what wow you a privileged unieducated high salary white collar worker not in expat bubble how magnanimous of you i can only dream of being like you like great that you have empathy for people there but that isnt what this thread is about\\n\\nbecause at the end of the day you gotta realise that this high col isnt a singaporeonly issue it isnt unique to singapore it isnt unique at all and i wanted to give ballpark figures its something people suffer from sf to australian cities like melbourne to hong kong and etc i dont want to speak for other cities because i never lived there but i can speak for sf because i do live and work there\\n\\nthe only reason why i pointed all this out is you were quick to just say its easier there because apparently everyone there earns big bucks you were quick to dismiss the situation by saying but salary thinking that by doing so it invalidates my point that high col isnt a singaporeonly thing its not true at all for the normal person yet you want to make the issue about me and you still persist\\n\\njust chill its an internet forum im free to say whatever i want and if the community doesnt like it they will downvote it for me its a good signal thats why there is a downvote button right if they think it doesnt contribute to the col discussion then i would have been downvoted\n",

       "      <td>hey this is bs and its wrong cpf retirement sum is 181k as of this year not 161  jokes aside it goes up by 2  a year im no math genius but for 30 year olds theyll need maybe double of 180k when theyre ready to retire\\n\\nthe whole problem with singapore is that it is a city like new york or tokyo or whatever expensive ass city that people work in for 30 years of their lives then the better off ones are able to afford land and retire in the suburbs\\n\\nin sg we dont have that unless we retire across the border in jb for the common folk \\n\\nlets do some simple non realistic math an above average couple from the age of 25 onward can make a cumulative salary of 10k 20 goes to cpf so that means theyre left with 8k lets say theyre really good with their savings and they spend 15k each per month leaving a total of 5k a month saved or 60k a year saved for both 30 years later theyll be 55 with a total of 18m in cash or 900k each considering that they stay employed all the time housing is 100 paid by cpf dont have kids and dont spend on extravagant things nor have illness befall on them it is possible but youd basically have to live a very very basic life and to be contented with the simplest things</td>\n",

       "13662   gt you literally said its not fun when you have to pay sgd 17k for a room you share toilet and common spaces with 23 other people when hdb rental in singapore is like sgd2k for a 2 bedroom apartment isnt that complaining\\n\\nthat is not my situation by the way im just giving ballpark figures based on the typical person in bay area\\n\\ngt yes you poor thing complaining on your 100k salary while this thread is full of people who earn less than half that maybe use some of that empathy you have for the people reading this thread\\n\\ni didnt even show off any salary data chill you assume that i am boasting i can tell you im not why would i boast in the first place what do i gain from stupid internet points\\n\\ngt i dont even know why you even started talking about col in the bay area when this thread is about sg talk about your rent for what wow you a privileged unieducated high salary white collar worker not in expat bubble how magnanimous of you i can only dream of being like you like great that you have empathy for people there but that isnt what this thread is about\\n\\nbecause at the end of the day you gotta realise that this high col isnt a singaporeonly issue it isnt unique to singapore it isnt unique at all and i wanted to give ballpark figures its something people suffer from sf to australian cities like melbourne to hong kong and etc i dont want to speak for other cities because i never lived there but i can speak for sf because i do live and work there\\n\\nthe only reason why i pointed all this out is you were quick to just say its easier there because apparently everyone there earns big bucks you were quick to dismiss the situation by saying but salary thinking that by doing so it invalidates my point that high col isnt a singaporeonly thing its not true at all for the normal person yet you want to make the issue about me and you still persist\\n\\njust chill its an internet forum im free to say whatever i want and if the community doesnt like it they will downvote it for me its a good signal thats why there is a downvote button right if they think it doesnt contribute to the col discussion then i would have been downvoted   \n",

       "13662   gt you literally said its not fun when you have to pay sgd 17k for a room you share toilet and common spaces with 23 other people when hdb rental in singapore is like sgd2k for a 2 bedroom apartment isnt that complaining\\n\\nthat is not my situation by the way im just giving ballpark figures based on the typical person in bay area\\n\\ngt yes you poor thing complaining on your 100k salary while this thread is full of people who earn less than half that maybe use some of that empathy you have for the people reading this thread\\n\\ni didnt even show off any salary data chill you assume that i am boasting i can tell you im not why would i boast in the first place what do i gain from stupid internet points\\n\\ngt i dont even know why you even started talking about col in the bay area when this thread is about sg talk about your rent for what wow you a privileged unieducated high salary white collar worker not in expat bubble how magnanimous of you i can only dream of being like you like great that you have empathy for people there but that isnt what this thread is about\\n\\nbecause at the end of the day you gotta realise that this high col isnt a singaporeonly issue it isnt unique to singapore it isnt unique at all and i wanted to give ballpark figures its something people suffer from sf to australian cities like melbourne to hong kong and etc i dont want to speak for other cities because i never lived there but i can speak for sf because i do live and work there\\n\\nthe only reason why i pointed all this out is you were quick to just say its easier there because apparently everyone there earns big bucks you were quick to dismiss the situation by saying but salary thinking that by doing so it invalidates my point that high col isnt a singaporeonly thing its not true at all for the normal person yet you want to make the issue about me and you still persist\\n\\njust chill its an internet forum im free to say whatever i want and if the community doesnt like it they will downvote it for me its a good signal thats why there is a downvote button right if they think it doesnt contribute to the col discussion then i would have been downvoted   \n",
