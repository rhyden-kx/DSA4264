      "13662     gt you literally said its not fun when you have to pay sgd 17k for a room you share toilet and common spaces with 23 other people when hdb rental in singapore is like sgd2k for a 2 bedroom apartment isnt that complaining\\n\\nthat is not my situation by the way im just giving ballpark figures based on the typical person in bay area\\n\\ngt yes you poor thing complaining on your 100k salary while this thread is full of people who earn less than half that maybe use some of that empathy you have for the people reading this thread\\n\\ni didnt even show off any salary data chill you assume that i am boasting i can tell you im not why would i boast in the first place what do i gain from stupid internet points\\n\\ngt i dont even know why you even started talking about col in the bay area when this thread is about sg talk about your rent for what wow you a privileged unieducated high salary white collar worker not in expat bubble how magnanimous of you i can only dream of being like you like great that you have empathy for people there but that isnt what this thread is about\\n\\nbecause at the end of the day you gotta realise that this high col isnt a singaporeonly issue it isnt unique to singapore it isnt unique at all and i wanted to give ballpark figures its something people suffer from sf to australian cities like melbourne to hong kong and etc i dont want to speak for other cities because i never lived there but i can speak for sf because i do live and work there\\n\\nthe only reason why i pointed all this out is you were quick to just say its easier there because apparently everyone there earns big bucks you were quick to dismiss the situation by saying but salary thinking that by doing so it invalidates my point that high col isnt a singaporeonly thing its not true at all for the normal person yet you want to make the issue about me and you still persist\\n\\njust chill its an internet forum im free to say whatever i want and if the community doesnt like it they will downvote it for me its a good signal thats why there is a downvote button right if they think it doesnt contribute to the col discussion then i would have been downvoted\n",
